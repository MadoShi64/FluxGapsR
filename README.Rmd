This is a package including four gap-filling methods for soil respiration data investigated in the study of Zhao et al. 2019 (to be published). The four methods are referred to as non-linear least squares (NLS), artificial neural networks (ANN), singular spectrum analysis (SSA) and expectation-maximization (EM). 

**Package installation**

First, make sure the package `devtools` is installed in R. If not, install the package by: 
```R
install.packages("devtools")
```
Then, install the `FluxGapsR` package in R by:
```R
devtools::install_github("junbinzhao/FluxGapsR")
```
The functioning of the package is based on other R packages: `tidyverse`,`spectral.methods`,`minpack.lm`,`mtsdi`,`neuralnet` and they must be installed before using the functions in the `FluxGapsR` package.

**Please cite the package as:**
(TBD)
